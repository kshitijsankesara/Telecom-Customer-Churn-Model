# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Model

Telecom industry faces fierce competition in satisfying its customers. The role of customer churn prediction system is to accurately predict the risk of customer churn and to interpret customer behavior and understand the factors affecting customer behavior. To build a model, I have analyzed demographic information, Telecom behavior, and variables related to company performance. 

I helped clients to know about customers, understand their behavior and target customers group based on the analysis. The predicted revenue loss was around $250,000. 

To begin with I performed data preprocessing, EDA, and variable extraction and selection for the models. I build the models and performed hyperparameter tuning and later evaluated the models using accuracy score and ROC curve.
